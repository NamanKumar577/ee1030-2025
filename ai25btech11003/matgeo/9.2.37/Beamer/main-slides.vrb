\frametitle{Theoretical Solution}
From Fig.1, the area bounded by the curve $y = x^2$ and line $y = x + 2$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{-1}^{2} [(x+2) - (x^2)] \,dx = \int_{-1}^{2} [2 + x -x^2] \,dx
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \int_{-1}^{2} [2 + x -x^2] \,dx = \dfrac{9}{2} = 4.5 \, sq.units
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
\boxed{\text{Therefore, the area bounded between $y=x^2$ and $y=x+2$ is 4.5 sq.units}}
\end{align*}
